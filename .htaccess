#Remove Trailing Slash
#This snippet will redirect paths ending in slashes to their non-slash-terminated counterparts (except for actual directories),
#e.g. http://www.example.com/blog/ to http://www.example.com/blog. This is important for SEO, since it’s recommended to have a canonical URL for every page.
